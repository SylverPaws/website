            <p>You must really like me! Or maybe what I told you was boring so you wanna read more..<br>Either way I'm flattered.</p>
            <p>When I last updated the code for this site I was 13, living in NSW, Australia and shit at web development.<br>I have been known to steal code quite often.</p>
            <p>I like to play some video games everynow and again, listen to music, talk to my girlfriend (love you acto <3) and to the lovely people in the Microsoft Community Discord server (<a href="https://aka.ms/community-discord">https://aka.ms/community-discord</a>) and do woodwork and metalwork projects.
            <p>I always love to have a chat, so please send me a DM on Discord (Ridgeway+#5122)<br>I welcome everyone to say hi!!!</p>
